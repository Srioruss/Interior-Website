                    <div class="date">12.09.2010</div>
                    <p>Construction of Antilia started in 2004 and it took over six years for this 27 storey massive mansion to be completed. In 2010 the building was ready.However apparently due to some vastu dosha, the Ambanis hesitated to move in immediately. They were then residing at the ancestral home Sea Winds at Cuffe Parade. It was finally only in 2011 that the Ambanis finally moved into Antilia. An elaborate 10 day griha pravesh puja ceremony was conducted in the house, by top priests, after which the family moved in.</p>
